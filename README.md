## Configuration Files / Examples

Configuration File examples are available [here](https://github.com/RedFalconKen/RedFalconFlightSystem-Heliz/tree/main/Config%20Files) for download. These are examples in nature and should not be considered complete items. A basic understanding of setting up economy files including events, types and more is required for this mod. Reports of despawning or items not spawning can be attributed to economy file errors.<br/>

Texture file examples to assist advanced users with rexturing existing models can be found [here](https://github.com/RedFalconKen/RedFalconFlightSystem-Heliz/tree/main/Tutorials/Retexturing). Users who attempt to create new textures must use the examples listed to create their own versions. You may **__NOT__** reupload the RFFS pack for rexture purposes. Rextures should only use the RFFS system as a dependency.

A PDF containing descriptions of the RFFS configuration settings can be found [here](https://github.com/RedFalconKen/RedFalconFlightSystem-Heliz/blob/main/RedFalcon%20Flight%20System%20Heliz%20Config%20Settings.pdf).
